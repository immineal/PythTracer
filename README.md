# Pythtracer

# W.I.P.

Pythtracer is a Python pathtracer designed to render photorealistic images. It is a ray tracer built on the principles of global illumination, which means that it simulates how light behaves in a natural environment, taking into account the interaction of light with the environment and with objects in the scene. It can generate images with advanced lighting effects such as shadows, reflections, refractions, and ambient occlusion.

Pythtracer supports a wide range of features, including:

- Camera: Exposure, Depth of Field, and Motion Blur
- Geometry: Spheres, Planes, Triangles, Quads, Cubes, and Cones
- Light Sources: Point Lights, Area Lights, Directional Lights, Spot Lights, Environment Lights, and Image-Based Lights
- Materials: Diffuse Lambert, Mirror, Glossy, Glass, and Metal
- Optimization: Multiprocessing, Anti-Aliasing, Threading, and Adaptive Sampling 
- Imaging: Gamma Correction, Tone Mapping, Color Correction, and Film Grain
- GUI: Render Window, Render Progress Bar, Render Preview Image, and Save Render Image

Pythtracer is open source software released under the MIT License.
